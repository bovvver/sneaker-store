<h2>sneaker-store ðŸ‘Ÿ</h2>
<p>
Full-stack <strong>educational</strong> project imitating real sneaker store.</p><br/></div>

## Installation with Docker
To install this application you'll need [Git](https://git-scm.com/), [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/), [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) and [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/)
Once you have them, do the following in your command line:
```bash
# Clone the repository
$ git clone https://github.com/MemeeMaster/sneaker-store

# Open repository
$ cd sneaker-store

# Build docker image with docker compose
$ docker compose build

# Create and run docker containers
$ docker compose up -d
```

## Usage
After successful installation, switch on your favourite web browser and go to **http://localhost:3000/sneaker-store/**

>  **Warning**: Make sure that you are on correct URL. During testing, I noticed that browsers like to redirect to https://localhost/sneaker-store/. If this is happening to you, just remove **"s"** from the protocol and add port **":3000"** to address or type the website URL manually.

Using the application is very simple. Just behave like on any internet store. 
- create your account,
- log in to your account,
- select sneaker that you like,
- choose quantity,
- go to cart and click 'Checkout',
- go forward and finish your order.
> :warning: **Disclaimer**: Remember that this is educational project. I'm so sorry, but I won't send you any product :grin:
